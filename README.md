# Weather-Wizard
A spin of the group project [EF-None](https://github.com/Zip-Final/EF-None/tree/main) to experiment with adding additional features.
Dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelbryantds/tornadoes) with the original data from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/)
Wind dataset is also from [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/)
Secondary goal is to practice with manipulating datasets and the logic beyond the front end.

Tornados come from: 
Thunderstorms 
 - Supercells
 - High force winds
 - Rising air? Condensation, Updrafts of air, Temperature change from bottom to top?
 - Meso-cyclone
 - Rear Flank Downdraft

So by tracking air movement and temperature should be able to figure out the chance of a tornado from those factors.
